# Large model files (optional - see notes below)
# Uncomment these if models are too large for GitHub (>100MB)
# models/*.pth
# checkpoints/*.pth
# experiments/**/*.pth

# Keep model files if they're small (<100MB each)
# GitHub allows files up to 100MB
# Your PyTorch models are likely 10-50MB, so they're fine to commit

# Training outputs (keep these - they're small CSV/PNG files)
# results/
# These should be committed to show your results

# Generated SUMO files (can be regenerated)
# sumo_files/*.net.xml
# sumo_files/*.rou.xml
# sumo_files/*.sumocfg
# Uncomment above if you want to regenerate these
# Keep them committed so others can run evaluation immediately
